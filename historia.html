      <div class="historiaDeLaBanda">
        <p>
          Last November, a jet-lagged Kodaline were driving into Pune, India,
          when a motorcyclist frantically flagged at them to pull over. Baffled
          by his urgency, they stopped at the side of a busy road. The reason?
          The man was a hardcore Kodaline fan and wanted to get a selfie with
          frontman Steve Garrigan. “We made his day or even his year,” laughs
          Garrigan. “He was so over the moon, it was great.”
        </p>
        <img class="imgHis" src="./img/k5.jpg" alt="foto del grupo" />

        <p>
          Such scenes were replicated throughout their first tour of Asia. In
          India they headlined the NH7 Weekender in front of 22,000 people.
          Their first show in South Korea sold-out within a minute. A music
          teacher in Indonesia posted a video of his entire class performing
          their breakthrough favourite ‘All I Want’. And whether they were
          arriving in Malaysia, Singapore or Vietnam, they’d be met by fans
          thrusting gifts upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That devotion is an extension of the huge appeal they’ve demonstrated
          at home. Kodaline’s ability to capture intense emotions in
          arena-scaled songs gives their music a universal quality. It’s been
          proven already, with three number one albums in Ireland and two top
          ten hits in the UK. 2019 alone saw them add 283 million streams at
          Spotify, spread between 79 countries, despite not releasing any new
          material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back home in Dublin, they sold-out two 15,000 capacity shows at St.
          Anne’s Park before playing to another 60,000 at Electric Picnic. The
          festival reached an emotional crescendo when Cranberries’ guitarist
          Noel Hogan joined Kodaline for ‘Zombie’, a whole-hearted tribute to
          the late Dolores O’Riordan. It also represented Kodaline going back to
          the beginning. Their first arena show came when the Cranberries
          invited them to open a gig in Paris back in 2012. All of which
          would’ve seemed impossible during the band’s modest early days in
          Dublin. Garrigan used to play gigs in local pubs, while he and
          guitarist Mark Prendergast used to busk together on Grafton Street.
          But Kodaline dreamed big, even if their rehearsal space was an
          abandoned school.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’ve seen what it’s like to have no following, so we’re very
          grateful that the Irish have taken to us,” reflects Garrigan. “It’s
          our home and a place that we love.”
        </p>
        <img class="imgHis1" src="./img/k6.jpg" alt="foto del grupo" />
        <p>
          While touring kept Kodaline in the public eye in 2019, they dedicated
          much of the year to making new music. Their previous album, 2018’s
          ‘Politics of Living’, saw them travel around to work with various
          producers and songwriters. This time around they took a different
          approach. The majority of the process revolved around the four of them
          in their modest recording space in Dublin. And rather than work on it
          continually, they kept the sessions fresh by breaking for weekends and
          short tours.
        </p>
        <p>
          With bassist Jason Boland leading the production side of things, this
          streamlined process took them back to their roots. That method was
          only intended to a trial. “But we soon realised it was working really
          well,” says Prendergast. “The approach on our last album was a
          learning curve for us, but this was really natural.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission, says Garrigan, was to focus on the emotion that informs
          many Kodaline fan favourites. “The main thing this time was to capture
          those emotions through everything. And we all sing, so we wanted to
          use a lot of harmonies and play to our strengths.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Those strengths are immediately apparent in the album’s first single
          ‘Wherever You Are’. Opening with Garrigan’s expressive topline backed
          by little more than swirling vocal harmonies, Kodaline build up the
          track towards its dramatic denouement. “‘Wherever You Are’ is about
          loved ones staying in your heart and mind even when they’re not with
          you,” he explains. “I wrote it specifically for my girlfriend as due
          to being away on tour all the time, we never really get to see each
          other.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Kodaline will often spend over half the year away on tour. When
          they’re back home, they’re usually planning, writing or recording the
          next record. It can be tough but they’re content with the sacrifice,
          as Boland explains.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Our wives and girlfriends know this is what we’ve wanted to do since
          we were kids. We’re living our dreams and they’re 100% supportive.
          They’re happy that we get to do want we want to do for a living,
          because that’s rare.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Garrigan wrote another new track ‘Sometimes’ while stewing over the
          aftermath of a bad show. While it’s written about a very specific
          experience, it’s still about a relatable emotion: losing your
          perspective over a challenging moment, and then finding ways to cope
          with your anxiety. It’s a topic that Garrigan has recently shared,
          opening up about his struggles with panic attacks. There’s no easy
          answer, but addressing such issues is a positive start. “There’s an
          Irish mentality that men can’t show emotions and that’s bullshit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          While Garrigan and Prendergast’s experiences of anxiety and depression
          feed into some of the new songs, one of the highlights is pure
          fiction. Possessing a 1950s Rat Pack feel with sumptuous vocal
          harmonies, ‘Last Day on Earth’ explores the tale of a couple vowing to
          stay together as the world hurtles towards its final apocalypse.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Our music is now as emotional as it can be,” says drummer Vinny May
          with contagious enthusiasm. “We’re really confident and optimistic
          about this record.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That emotion also spreads far beyond the band themselves. Named after
          an early Kodaline song, the High Hopes choir uses music as a way for
          homeless people to change their lives through music. More recently,
          Voices of Service, an American soul group consisting of military
          veterans, have released a gospel version of ‘Brother’. And that early
          hit ‘All I Want’ is still being discovered, with countless fans
          embracing it as a song that helps them through a grieving process.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s the power of Kodaline. They’re four regular people who explore
          topics that everyone experiences. That also inspires a wider community
          in their following, with fans becoming life-long friends with people
          they meet at the band’s shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We want to do this for the rest of our lives,” concludes May. “We
          want to continue to grow and reach a wider audience. That ambition has
          been there from the start and is still there now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a cheeky glint in his eye and laughter all-round as he
          summarises the Kodaline story so far. “We’re lucky fuckers!”
